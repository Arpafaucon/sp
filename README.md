## Overview

This project aims at building a ROS software stack able to coordinate the flight of multiple drones (bitcraze Crazyflie) over a target area, in order to cover it as a surveillance system would. 

This repo contains the code for this project, that encompasses:
- long-term drone placement
- trajectory planning
- control and drone avoidance
- hot replacement of faulty drones
